text = "[A ripped-out page from a journal. In the corner, the letters “TH” are embossed, in addition in light ink, a vine of little flowers details the bottom edge of the paper. Now, adorned with the mechanic writing of the automaton, it reads,

“My dearest Vincent,
I know you will be upset about what I have arranged, but lying about the true inventor of our products has created a rift between us that I fear could tear us apart. I have attempted to orchestrate a comfortable life for us without the stress of the company, where we and our children can live without these limitations.

I apologize for going behind your back and working with Charles, I know you detest him so, but there was no other solution. 

Even if this betrayal should separate us forever, you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.

Yours forever,
Theodora”]
