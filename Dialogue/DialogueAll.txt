01-01-11 ARCHER: Last stop?

02-09-02 [A worn guestbook, the most recent entries are… “T. Harker… March 4… C. Connors … March 4… V. Harker…” No date.]									ARCHER: Wow… Harker Inventions Company and Connors Technology are two pretty big companies, I did a job for Connors a little while ago… He seemed a little shady, but that’s expected in my industry. I try to just do my hits without knowing the victim, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it had been that Harker CEO… I wonder if it was T. Harker or V. Harker?
02-09-03 [As you flip some pages, you notice all other pages are illegible to you except for the one you are already on]

05-01-04 That would be rude...
05-01-06 Vincent: You? Again?
05-01-11 ARCHER: I remember this guy… I was called to do this hit months ago. It’s a miracle I accomplished it with the little time I was given.
05-01-16 VINCENT: You got the wrong person last time… Just leave me alone, okay?
05-01-21 ARCHER: Wrong guy? I never get the wrong guy.
05-01-26 VINCENT: I’m dead. You did your job, it’s over. It doesn’t matter. Just go.

05-01-36 VINCENT: I don’t really have a choice, do I?… Listen, I have this paper… My wife gave it to me but I never understood what it was for. Look into you, will you?

#Note 1
06-02-00 [Although this paper may have revolutionary ideas, they do not seem to be important for you, nor anyone you have met so far]
06-02-01 I dont think I should talk to a paper, even if the paper seems more educated than I am.
06-02-02 [ A ripped-out page from a journal. In the corner, the letters “TH” are embossed, in addition in light ink, a vine of little flowers details the bottom edge of the paper. Not a lot of inventors keep their work on a personal stationery.																							 The page is covered with sketches, the biggest one in the center looks identical to the automaton sitting on the desk. Messily scribbled notes, arrows, and other symbols surround the drawing, explaining the intricate mechanics of the machine. I have no idea what any of it means, but it looks impressive.]
06-02-03 I see no use for this paper beside being a nice short read.
06-02-04 I don't think I should do that, that paper has already suffered nougn by being ripped from its stationery.

07-01-02 A worn bellhop uniform... The name tag reads "Pete".

#Washbin area(pretty much the whole room)
07-02-00 There's nothing there I need.
07-02-01 It’s just me in here. (at least I hope so)
07-02-02 This place may have been state of the art at one time. Years before I was born that is.
07-02-03 No need, my clothes are clean. 
07-02-04 I dont think I should step over the Housekeeper's hard work.

#Note 2
07-03-00 I dont need a page that contains a simple list
07-03-01 [ you try to talk to the note... all you hear back is some water dripping from the hangin clothes nearby.]
07-03-02 [ A ripped-out page from a journal. In the corner, the letters “TH” are embossed, in addition in light ink, a vine of little flowers details the bottom edge of the paper. It’s not often someone has personalized stationary, especially not for what follows on the page. In cursive handwriting, the paper reads “March 4th at dusk”. Under is a list, “Vincent does not need to work again, allowance for a comfortable living, full education for children”. ]
07-03-03 Theres plenty of cleaning tools around, I don't think i should use this note for doing so.
07-03-04 I Dont want to do that...

08-01-03 I am a poet, but I don't have anything to write with.
08-01-04 I need to stop wasting time.

#Desk and chairs
08-02-00 There's no reason to do that.
08-02-01 No one's there to talk to.
08-02-02 So much dust… These desks have not been used in a long time. I guess they will stay that way for much longer. 
08-02-03 [You consider moving the chairs down and sitting. You quickly reconsider after realizing you'd be covered in cobweds after you're done ]
08-02-04 I don't need to go there... too many spiders.
